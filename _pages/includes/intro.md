I am currently a Master student in [Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Robotic Perception and Intelligence](http://robotics.lonwin.net/index.aspx) under the direction of [Prof. Max Q.-H. Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DxDCU7AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at Southern University of Science and Technology since 2021.09. My research focuses on Robotic Manipulation, Object Reorientation, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Currently, I am working on Robotic Manipulation vis Learning Regrasping. My ultimate goal is to build a General Manipulation Model in the unstructured environment without object CAD models.
