I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab](https://robotics-and-computer-vision-lab.github.io/RCV-Lab.github.io/) under the direction of [Prof. Hong ZHANG](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=J7UkpAIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at Southern University of Science and Technology since 2022.09. My research focuses on Robotics, SLAM and Computer Vision. Currently, I am working on Robot Person Following, which is a complicated system including multiple basic modules including detection, tracking, re-identification, control and so on. My ultimate goal is to make the robot look like a puppy following its master forever.
