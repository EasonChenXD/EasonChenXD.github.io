<!-- I am currently a Master student in [Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Robotic Perception and Intelligence](http://robotics.lonwin.net/index.aspx) under the direction of [Prof. Max Q.-H. Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DxDCU7AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at Southern University of Science and Technology since 2021.09. My research focuses on Robotic Manipulation, Object Reorientation, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Currently, I am working on Robotic Manipulation vis Learning Regrasping. My ultimate goal is to build a General Manipulation Model in the unstructured environment without object CAD models. -->
I am currently a Master's student at the [Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Robotic Perception and Intelligence](http://robotics.lonwin.net/index.aspx), under the direction of [Prof. Max Q.-H. Meng](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/mengqinghu.html), at the Southern University of Science and Technology since September 2021. I am excited to be joining the [ABE Plant Sensor Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ABEPlantSensorLab) at Purdue University under the supervision of [Prof. Jian Jin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~jinjian/Index.htm) in Fall 2024.
My research focuses on robotic manipulation, computer vision, and their applications in agriculture. My ultimate goal is to develop practical robotic solutions for agriculture that achieve commercial success.
